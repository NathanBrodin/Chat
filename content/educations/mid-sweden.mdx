I am currently doing an Exchange semester at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall.
My classes are:
- Distributed Systems
- Distributed Algorithms
- IoT
- Advanced Networking Systems
- Swedish

For the IoT class, we had to build a REST Server, a COAP client and an MQTT Server. I chose to do all of them in Rust.
I also wrote all of my Distributed Algoritms math exercices in Latex.

The people around me are very active, so I got into sports as well (Swimming, skating, climbing...).
I choosed this destination because it was the closest opportunity to Norway (where I'm planning to settle) and because they have snowy and cold winter, which I love.
So I am also spending my winter snowboarding as I would like to turn my life around that.
