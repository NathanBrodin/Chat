I did an Exchange semester in Finland, for the first semester of my third year.
Finland was really cool, it was my first time in full autonomy, so this was great for my growth. And I guess I really loved that because I didn't stopped living abroad after that.
University wasn't that cool. Somehow my home school that chose courses for us took things that where for first or second year, while we were in third, so this was very easy (and boring). I never liked lectures anyway...

I know the stereotype about Finnish people that are reserved, but I haven't met a single Finnish in the 4 months I spent there lol.
Otherwise, amazing trip to Lapland with all of the exchange students.
