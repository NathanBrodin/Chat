We provided support for 23 students at RoboRave Craon 2022. Our six teams actively participated in the competition, with two of them joining the Line-Following event (one of which emerged as the tournament champion), and the remaining four teams taking part in the SumoBot event, securing 3rd and 4th place among the 110 teams that participated in the event.

RoboRave is a regional robotics competition designed for middle school students.
