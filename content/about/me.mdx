### Professional Journey

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering at ESIEA, a French engineering school in Laval, France, where I major in Software Engineering. My studies began in 2020, and I am on track to graduate in July 2025.
At ESIEA, we follow a unique structure known as an integrated master's program. This consists of a two-year preparatory cycle, followed by a three-year engineering cycle. Below is a summary of key experiences during my academic journey:

**3rd Year**: Completed a mandatory exchange semester in Kokkola, Finland.
**Summer Between 3rd and 4th Year**: Did a two-month optional internship at DNB in Oslo, Norway.
**4th Year**: Completed a mandatory 4.5-month internship at DNB in Oslo, Norway.
**5th Year**: I did an optional exchange semester in Sundsvall, Sweden, followed by a six-month internship to conclude my studies, for DNB again.

Then, I will start a full time job as a Software Engineering.
I am available to hire for the entry level job.

I am planning to settle in Norway, I love snowboarding and would like to be close the best mountains. I want to do freeriding, big mountain and ride steep couloirs.
Norway as an incredible work culture, work life balance and a very good quality of life so I really see it as the best place to live.

I started my master's degree quite randomly. In France, we have the platform "ParcourSup" to register our choices for studies, and it opens in February, and one month before that, I still had no idea what to do with my life.
I come from an uneducated family so having to study anything was quite optional. But I got forced by my mom to attend a "University fair" in my town, and found out about ESIEA. For some reason I got really interested and now I was motivated to start a 5 years study program with a massive student loan.
To this day, I believe it was my greatest life decision, as I truly love what I am doing. I got to experience crazy stuff, meet amazing people and I really enjoy what I'm doing with my life now.
It was a lot of hard work, but worth it.

If I am not at work I am most probably snowboarding.
