### Professional Journey

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering at ESIEA, a French engineering school in Laval, France, where I major in Software Engineering. My studies began in 2020, and I am on track to graduate in August 2025.
At ESIEA, we follow a unique structure known as an integrated master's program. This consists of a two-year preparatory cycle, followed by a three-year engineering cycle. Below is a summary of key experiences during my academic journey:

**3rd Year**: Completed a mandatory exchange semester in Kokkola, Finland.
**Summer Between 3rd and 4th Year**: Undertook a two-month optional internship at DNB in Oslo, Norway.
**4th Year**: Completed a mandatory 4.5-month internship at DNB in Oslo, Norway.
**5th Year**: Planning to participate in an optional exchange semester in Sundsvall, Sweden, followed by a six-month internship to conclude my studies.

Then, I will start a full time job as a Software Engineering.
I am available to hire for both the 6 months internship and the entry level job.
