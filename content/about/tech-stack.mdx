I love working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): For a fast and easy way to use React.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): For a strongly typed language.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Because no one likes writing CSS anymore.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): For hosting and deployment (I love everything they do, from Next to Turbo...).
- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev): For authentication and user management.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): For a modern and customizable UI library.

But at work, I'm also using the following technologies:

- [React.js](https://react.dev): For a fast and easy way to use React.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): For a strongly typed language.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com): For styling React components.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org): For state management.
- [Azure web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/): For hosting and deployment.
