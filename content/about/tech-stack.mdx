I love working with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): What could we do without Type Safety?
- [React.js](https://react.dev): Components with inline markup is the way. Don't listen to the jealous Svelte and Vue detractors.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Because no one likes writing CSS anymore.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): Is there even anything to explain here?
- [Tanstack/**](https://tanstack.com/): I fell into it, every package is so good.
- [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/): They know a thing or two about great DX.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): I am not as big of a fan as I was before, and I'm tired of dealing with hydration errors, but for a full stack framework it's still a good framework.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): For hosting and deployment (who doesn't love a good free tier, and still awesome UX).


At previous jobs, I was unfortunatly forced to use the following technologies:

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com): For styling React components, which doesn't resolve any CSS issues, but create more instead. I don't even understand the idea being it, just use CSS modules and stop being weird.
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction): Even worse.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org): For state management, actually quite good, I like Redux RTK.
- [Azure web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/): For hosting and deployment, the slow and hard and expensive way.

I'm on Linux at work (on Windows at my previous job, still have nightmares about it) and Mac at home (still the best). I code on [Zed](https://zed.dev/) with VIM mode (YES, I use VIM btw.). I'm on Arc/Zen.
