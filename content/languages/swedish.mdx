description: "Basic understanding of Swedish"

I followed a Swedish course at Uni, and even got a B for it, but it doesn't mean I'm any good in Swedish.
I can understand basic stuff, and ask very simple questions, but I haven't put much efforts into it.
And my accent is probably quite horrible, and I'm mixing Norwegian and Swedish so it doesn't help.
