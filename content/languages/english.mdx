I still have a strong French accent, but my English is still comprehensible.
I often have to repeat myself due to my accent, which is quite anoying, but that's on me...

And one very anoying thing is that even after more than a year abroad, people have never been able to understand on the first try when I say my name "Nathan". I believe I am saying it correctly but since no one does, so I guess I am in the wrong.
