My school, ESIEA, holds an annual competition called the "Scientific and Technical Exhibition" in Laval, France, to showcase the best of the students' projects.
Though we didn't secure the first place, my team and I earned two second-place awards (jury and public) for our project "B-moveOn," a mobile app aimed at optimizing bicycle deliveries.
