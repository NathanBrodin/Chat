Second internship at DNB, building tools and interfaces for DNB's Chatbots.

This time, I build the frontend of a RAG Chatbot.
We used React, TypeScript, Redux (with RTK Query) and styled-components.

I got to work on the project from the very start and was able to finish it.
I put a great care about testing as I wrote 106 tests (vitest) which covers 92% of the codebase.

This was a fun internship, the new interns where really nice and I get along well with my coworkers.
