Right after finishing my Master's degree, I took the plane to the far north, in Tromsø. I got a job at "Capia", a company that no one knows about, even the locals. It's a company running since 2008, with 7 active employees. It's a data analytic company, mainly in the fishing industry.

What I was seeking in working there was the complet freedom over the frontend. With my previous work experiences, I was forced to use a bad tech stack that didn't fit the job, I had to implement designs that I was not a fan of, and implement products that were far away from their true potential, but considering the bureaucracy of big companies, the goal of the team, I didn't saw any opportunities for me to perform and do great things.
So when I saw Capia, did a few interviews, I saw that they didn't knew a thing about frontend, that I would have the lead on that, and that I could do it the way I want (so the best way, of course).

I went full on, and could finally work with great tech, make a user-focused app, and just do what I do best.
I was able to choose Vite+Tanstack Router, Tanstack Query, Tanstack Table, these things are amazing. No more create-react-app mess. I was able to push for Tailwind CSS, no more emotion-js or styled-components. To this day I still don't understand why these things exist, and why people are choosing it. And on top of that, shadcn/ui. So finally being able to use shadcn and Tailwind is really something good for DX. It's crazy how it's people that don't know a thing about frontend and that are not the one programming that decides for this kind of things.

I also had UI lead, finally making some good apps.

Good UI + Good DX = Nathan happy.
