I am complete my final 6 months internship at DNB, in the same time as the last two time. This will allow me to finish my master's degree.
This time, I was working a bit on everything. I was fixing bugs here and there. Some codebases are really messy so it's not that fun to work on it.

Here's the boring Linkedin description I use for this job:

```md
Worked across multiple AI products used by 100k+ users. Pushed production code weekly.

- Built full E2E test suite (350+ tests across browsers) with Playwright, optimized CI to run in under 90s with caching and sharding
- Refactored styling architecture, improving scalability and consistency
- Led theming and dark mode implementation for DNB’s public chatbot UI (1.5M+ conversations/year)
- Shipped 15+ features across all team projects
- Migrated a production app from Gatsby to Vite, reducing build times by 60% and improving DX
- Contributed to DNB's open-source design system (Eufemia)
- Wrote technical documentation, analysis reports, and improved the overall DX for the team

Went beyond dev work to bridge design and engineering, helping transform rough concepts into polished, scalable UI. Final internship credited toward my Master’s degree, graded 92/100 for technical depth and delivery.
