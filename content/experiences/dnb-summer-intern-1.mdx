I did a very first internship at DNB, Norway's largest financial services group, for about 2 months and a half.
I was working with the "Emerging Tech" department, which is responsible for all the AI chatbots of the company.

So my project for the summer was to develop the "Chat Admin Panel", an internal tool to configure the chatbots.
I built the frontend in React, with styled-components and Redux. I made all the pipelines to deploy it on AWS, which was quite a challenge as I needed to automate different environments, security rules and all....

I worked closely with the UX designer of the team to make it fancy, and the backend engineer to make everything work.
