As a summer intern at DNB, Norway's largest financial services group, I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the company's "Emerging Technologies" department as a Frontend Engineer Intern.

I was responsible for developing the frontend and deployment of the "Chat Admin Panel," an internal tool that enables AI trainers and managers to customize various elements within DNB's chatbots.

I worked closely with the designer to create an accessible and visually appealing interface and collaborated with my mentor to ensure seamless integration with the backend.
