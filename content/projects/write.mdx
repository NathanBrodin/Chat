Write is a online markdown editor that allows you to write and preview markdown in real-time. It also supports exporting to PDF.

Started as a clone of [Notion](https://notion.so), I wanted to create a simple and easy to use markdown editor that could be used by anyone.
The key principle was to keep it simple and easy to use.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): For a fast and easy way to use React.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Because no one likes writing CSS anymore.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): For hosting and deployment.
- [Convex](https://convex.dev): Real-time database enabling file syncing.
- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev): For authentication and user management.
