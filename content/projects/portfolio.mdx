This website is my personal portfolio. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Inspired by [Apple's](https://apple.com) bento grid design, I created mine in the [#about](/#about) to represent my key skills and interests.

I was also heavily helped by [Chronark's](https://chronark.dev) portfolio, which I used as a base for my own.
