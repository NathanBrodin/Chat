I can't really call myself an open source contributor. But I got some very small PRs that got merged, so I'm happy about it.

- [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/33902#event-18569118982): I added 20 lines of docs about Github Copilot for Enterprise.
- [Coss](https://github.com/cosscom/coss/pull/442): There was a visual bug on Firefox with the rounded border of a table.
- [Coss](https://github.com/cosscom/coss/pull/446): I changed one word that was a typo (what would they even do without me ?!).

Also all my projects or OSS.
