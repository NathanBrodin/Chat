Nathan has been a great addition to our team during his internship. He has shown great understanding for the technology we use as well as eager to learn new things. I would like to especially compliment him for his Frontend development skills. Nathan is quick to learn, works very efficiently, is adaptable, and presents possibilities to improve UI/UX if he sees them. I am very happy to have been working closely with Nathan, and I am sure he will make a great career as a Software Engineer!
