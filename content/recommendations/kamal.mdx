It was a pleasure working with Nathan during his summer internship at DNB. He is an outstanding developer with a strong grasp of web development in React. Additionally, he excels at swiftly acquiring new technologies and applying them productively. I was impressed by his work ethic and punctuality. I wholeheartedly endorse Nathan for web development and beyond.
